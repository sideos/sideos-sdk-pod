Before commiting you need to check if the idenfySDK Target version and build is incremented by one.

After that make a STAGE_SDK-* Tag. Commit if needed before the tag. Push the updates. Wait for the build result.

If the build is successful, test it locally with using testing branch. If everything is alright, tag it PROD_SDK-* and push new tag. Wait for the deployment.

Building Static SDK:

Comment out use_frameworks! in the podfile
Comment out Sentry pod
delete weak_framework Sentry from project setttings
pod cache clean --all, pod deintegate. Delete podfile.lock, clear derrived data
Install new pods
Build the SDK as usual with bitrise
